/// This Map uses a similar strategy to BTreeMap to ensure cache
/// efficient performance on modern hardware while still providing
/// log(N) get, insert, and remove operations.
///
/// For good performance, it is very important to understand
/// that clone is a fundamental operation, it needs to be fast
/// for your key and data types, because it's going to be
/// called a lot whenever you change the map. If your key and
/// data types are cheap to clone (like e.g. Arc), and you
/// perform your update operations in largish batches, then it
/// is possible to get very good performance, even approaching
/// that of a standard HashMap.
///
/// # Why
///
/// Which begs the question, why would anyone ever want to use
/// a data structure where very careful structuring of key and
/// data type, and careful batching, MIGHT APPROACH the
/// performance of a plain old HashMap, it seems a silly thing
/// to work on. I know of two cases.
///
/// 1. Multiple threads can read this structure even while one
/// thread is updating it.
///
/// 2. You can take a snapshot and e.g. write it to disk, or
/// replicate it to another process without stopping reads or
/// writes.
///
/// There is some nuance to #1, because HashMap is generally
/// faster to read than a BTree. In a pure read application
/// it's the obvious choice when you don't require sorted
/// data. In a mixed read/write scenario at 4 reads for every
/// write HashMap is already the same speed as chunkmap for
/// reading a 10M entry map. That's a pretty write heavy
/// application, and wouldn't be news by itself. The real
/// killer of the mutable strucures is large operations, any
/// kind of housekeeping operation that's going to touch a
/// large number of keys can be death for availability,
/// holding onto a write lock for multiple hundreds of
/// milliseconds, even seconds, even longer. Sure it's
/// possible to amortize this in some cases by doing your
/// housekeeping in small batches, but that can be complex,
/// and it isn't always possible, and readers still pay a
/// price even if it's amortized.
///
/// That brings us to #2, which is really the mother of all
/// housekeeping operations. There is no way to amortize
/// taking a consistent snapshot, the best you can possibly do
/// is hold the write lock long enough to make a complete copy
/// of the data, if you even have the memory for that. God
/// help you if you miscalculate and start swapping while
/// you're making that copy, holding the write lock while your
/// disk or if you're lucky SSD churns away moving pages back
/// and forth between main memory, you may be holding that
/// lock for a long long time. Chunkmap gives you free
/// snapshots in exchange for slower writes, which, carefully
/// considered don't even need to be that much slower.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// use std::string::String;
/// use self::immutable_chunkmap::map::Map;
///
/// let m =
///    Map::new()
///    .insert(String::from("1"), 1).0
///    .insert(String::from("2"), 2).0
///    .insert(String::from("3"), 3).0;
///
/// assert_eq!(m.get("1"), Option::Some(&1));
/// assert_eq!(m.get("2"), Option::Some(&2));
/// assert_eq!(m.get("3"), Option::Some(&3));
/// assert_eq!(m.get("4"), Option::None);
